I find this challenge to be easy than last time because I already know the sorting algorithm to be used. 

The last time I did this, I'm still new to programming. I just got all my certification from Freecodecamp.org finished and I find Bubble Sort a bit intimidating back then. Last time, I also tried exploring alot ways to sort the input without following the ***"Bubble Sort"*** idea hence it takes me a long time to complete it. 

As of now, I believe it still took me a bit of time to complete the challenge and that is because I solved that code two-ways using the ***while*** and ***do-while*** loop. 

**Here are the steps I did to address the challenge:**

1. I created a function called ***swap()*** to handle the swapping of elements on the unsorted array input.
2. On the ***bubbleSort()*** function, I copied the input array and stored it in ***inputArray variable*** because I am trying to follow the ***Pure Function*** principle.  I then declared a nested loop ***(while/do-whle and a for loop)*** to handle the itiration on the input array. 
3. Inside the nested loop function, i utilized the swap function declared earlier. I then spliced the inputAray elements replacing the original value with the swapped values. 
4. I return the sorted inputArray. 

***Found on the folder directory is the two approaches I wrote on solving the challenge.***
