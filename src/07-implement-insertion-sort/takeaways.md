I've been busy with work related activities and didn't have time to do personal coding sessions hence the completion of this challenge was delayed. 

For this challenge, It took me some time to understand on how will I do the loop backwards starting from the last sorted element. I also had a hard time on how to keep track of the last sorted element. 

However, I realized that I can keep track of the last sorted value by taking/declaring the iterator on the inner loop outside of the for() parenthesis. I also rememberd that I can include more than one ondition on the for() loops conditionals to check on the current value and sorted value. Once I realized that, I was able to solve the challenge.
