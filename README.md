# Welcome to my repository!

This repository contains the Coding interview Prep challenges that I wrote using ***TypeScript***. 

The coding challenges and their code solutions are organized by folder. All challenges on this repository are from the [FreeCodeCamp.org]([https://www.example.com](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/)https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/coding-interview-prep/)

I did this to learn more about the different **Algorithms** and **Data Structures** and to learn how to use typeScript.

I made this repository ***Public*** to help my fellow developers have references on their coding journeys. You can use the code in this repository but make sure that you understand it. It's for your own sake.
